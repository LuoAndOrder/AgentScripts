# AGENTS.MD

## Agent Protocol
- Contact: Kevin Luo (@luoandorder, kwluo90@gmail.com).
- Workspace: `~/workspace`.
- 3rd-party/OSS (non-luoandorder): clone under `~/workspace/oss`.
- Files: repo or `~/workspace/AgentScripts`.
- PRs: use `gh pr view/diff` (no URLs).
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2026 sources

## Flow & Runtime
- Use repo’s package manager/runtime; no swaps w/o approval.

## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Remotes under `~/workspaces`
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

## Tools
### gh
- GitHub CLI for PRs/CI/releases. Given issue/PR URL (or `/pull/5`): use `gh`, not web search.
- Examples: `gh issue view <url> --comments -R owner/repo`, `gh pr view <url> --comments --files -R owner/repo`.

### tmux
- Use only when you need persistence/interaction (debugger/server).
- Quick refs: `tmux new -d -s codex-shell`, `tmux attach -t codex-shell`, `tmux list-sessions`, `tmux kill-session -t codex-shell`.

<frontend_aesthetics>
Avoid “AI slop” UI. Be opinionated + distinctive.

Do:
- Typography: pick a real font; avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults.
- Theme: commit to a palette; use CSS vars; bold accents > timid gradients.
- Motion: 1–2 high-impact moments (staggered reveal beats random micro-anim).
- Background: add depth (gradients/patterns), not flat default.

Avoid: purple-on-white clichés, generic component grids, predictable layouts.
